RocktNet Project

This repository contains the implementation of RocktNet, a deep learning-based approach for netlist extraction from analog images.

The traaining dataa generation code is in the `Generation` folder, just follow the steps below to generate your own dataset: 
```bash
cd Generation
bash ./do.bash
```

The format is given in the YOLO training format in default. You can modify the code to fit your own dataset format and control the generation details.

The netlist extraction code is in the `Netlist` folder. To run the netlist extraction on your own images, follow the steps below:
```bash
cd Netlist
# modify the model path and image path in a_ocradvanced.py
python3 a_ocradvanced.py
```
